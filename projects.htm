	<p align="left";>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our 1A final project as part of a team of four students at University of Waterloo, we decided to build a Plotter. Our team was provided with a Lego kit to complete the project.  We divided the plotter into two main parts. The first part was the tray that moved in X direction and the tool (pencil/pen) holder that moved in the Y direction. We provided the user with two different choice of tools. The plotter was able to take .SVG file from a computer and plot it on a paper. It was also able to provide the user to have, LIVE CONTROL, meaning the user could use Joystick/controller to Plot anything.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a final project for my CS course, I made game in JAVA inspired by the game STACKED. The game had multiple levels and as each level was completed, the game would get harder.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of a team of four, we were given parts of a fuel cell car. Our task was to assemble the car together and use the fuel cells provided to run the car. The next task was to program the car to follow a black line while avoiding obstacles in the way by using the sensors provided. We were able to complete the tasks given successfully.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of my designing/developing experience was during my <a href="work.htm" target="_blank">Coop term</a>. There are a couple projects that I have done through the years. They include a 3D-Printed Puzzle, Rube Goldberg Machine, Cellphone Stand and various others</p>
	<br>
	<h2>3D-Printed Puzzle</h2>
	<p>I designed and 3D printing a sliding puzzle using AutoCAD. The puzzle when put together properly represented our school’s mascot.</p>
