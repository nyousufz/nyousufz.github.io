	<h2 style="font-family:Arial Black; text-align:center;">Clickmox (Mechatronics Engineering Intern)</h2>
	<p style="text-align:center;">I worked at <a href="http://www.clickmox.com" target="_blank">Clickmox Solutions </a> as a Mechatronics Engineering Intern from January 2017 to May 2017. I worked at Clickmox Solutions as a Mechatronics Engineering Intern from January 2017 to May 2017. The company’s main focus is to develop Scanning systems for mines capable of scanning hard to access area. Clickmox uses drones, carts and other types of remote control vehicles to access those areas. While working there I was directly involved in designing and developing serval of their products. One of the earliest products that I worked on is available in the market right now and others are under development. </p>

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designed and developed a Laser based 3D scanning system for Clickmox Solutions using SolidWorks and Geomagic. A single laser scanner with a scan angle of 270 degrees and scan radius of 15m was used as a scanner. I, along with my co-worker worked together to develop an enclosure for the scanner to allow the users to scan 360 degrees while protecting the scanner from the harsh environment of underground mines. The enclosure consisted of a motor, Raspberry Pie and a battery pack to allow easy scanning and mobility. The scanner was tested and proven to work very well both underground and above ground. The next task was to make the scanner versatile, so it can be mounted on any type of moving vehicle. I designed a mounting piece for the scanner which allowed the scanner to be mounted on any vehicle.  The scanner is on sale and is the main product of the company right now. </p>

	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designed and developed a scanning system similar to the one before. Unlike the one listed above, this scanning system is be able to provide the user with a live map as the scanner scans an area.</p>

	<h3>3D Tube Scanner:</h3>
	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; designed and developed this Scanner specifically for small and hard to access holes. Some of the wholes were as small as 7 cm in diameter. Keeping that in mind and considering the safety of the scanner, I came up with a couple of designs. The design that we decided on was the slimmest and versatile among the other designs. The Tube Scanner is currently under development.</p>
